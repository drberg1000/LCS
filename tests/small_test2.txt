Japan wants to be the first to tap super high speed access to the Internet and has just launched a satellite that would provide a boost to this technology. The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) spearheaded the satellite launch on Saturday. JAXA's satellite-fired fast Internet project is a successful tie-up with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and targets to provide the service to businesses and homes. A JAXA news release said: "The new technology would enhance Internet connections in the Asian region with a promise of 1.2 gigabytes per second." The JAXA also cited that the new technology "will make possible great advances in telemedicine, which will bring high-quality medical treatment to remote areas, and in distance education, connecting students and teachers separated by great distances," JAXA said.
