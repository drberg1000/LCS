Japan says a satellite launched into orbit Saturday could deliver Internet service many times faster than cable or DSL. The WINDS satellite was launched aboard a rocket in a joint venture between the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, or JAXA, and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, CNN reported. The satellite will test new technology that aims to deliver "super high-speed Internet" service around the world, said a statement from JAXA. Initially, subscribers with small dishes in the Asia-Pacific region close to Japan would connect to the Internet through the satellite, CNN reported. "Among other uses, this will make possible great advances in telemedicine, which will bring high-quality medical treatment to remote areas, and in distance education, connecting students and teachers separated by great distances," the statement said. The satellite was put into orbit from Japan's Yoshinobu Launch Complex at the Tanegashima Space Center.
