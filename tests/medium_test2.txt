KENNEDY SPACE CENTER -- After a 1.5 million-mile journey, Atlantis crossed Central America and headed north through South Florida just minutes before Commander Steve Frick landed it at the space center Wednesday morning, falling from space at the rate of 290 feet per second. The veteran astronaut told Mission Control in Houston it was a great day to land the shuttle at Kennedy Space Center after almost 13 days in space attaching a new lab to the international space station. "We are happy to be home," he said at a post-landing conference some four hours after touching down. "We watched the front move out yesterday, and we knew there was perfect weather behind it." It took the crew more than an hour to climb from the shuttle and make the traditional walk around the underbelly to check for damage caused during launch. NASA officials and the crew unanimously agreed the shuttle was pristine and suffered little to no tile damage during the ascent Feb. 7. Now Endeavour will be readied for a March 11 launch to deliver parts of a Japanese lab in the first rapid-fire shuttle missions in years. "It feels good. I mean, it feels really good to be having missions back to back like this again. It almost feels like the mid-90s again," said launch director Mike Leinbach, referring to one of NASA's hottest shuttle streaks. The just-completed mission expanded the floating outpost when several spacewalks were conducted to attach Columbus, the European Space Agency's contribution to the international project. The Europeans were ecstatic that the research module -- nearly two decades in the making -- finally made it to space. Nearly 300 people from the agency witnessed the launch, but a mere six for the landing, said Franco Bonacina, spokesman for the European Space Agency. "It is the excitement of the launch that most people in Europe wanted to see," he said. "Still, it is a great accomplishment for us. We are glad that Hans (Schlegel) is back. It is another great day." German astronaut Leopold Eyharts stayed behind to finish attaching Columbus, a science research laboratory with an outdoor box used to expose plants and experiments to the elements of space. He plans to return on the shuttle flight next month. The Columbus lab's launch was postponed in December because of a fuel sensor problem and barely beat the weather during its first attempt earlier this month. NASA officials breathed a sigh of relief when they were able to squeeze the liftoff in between two storm fronts crossing through the area. The crew was awakened at 12:55 a.m. Wednesday morning to John Phillip Sousa's patriotic song "Hail to the Spirit of Liberty." It was selected by the family of pilot Alan Poindexter. There was plenty to do in preparation for deorbit burn around 8 a.m., which brings the shuttle back into Earth's atmosphere. Depending on body size, each crew member must rehydrate with a salty drink and suit up for the intensely hot re-entry. After landing, the astronauts were not the only ones on the shuttle to have to adjust to gravity. NASA staff had to unload biology and medical experiments that also react to the effects of gravity. Re-entry was a great experience for 46-year-old first-time flier Alan Poindexter. "It came in a lot faster than I expected, but it was very smooth with no surprises," he said.
